# Couples-first beta evidence

## Authority and completion

The [September 8 Notion brief](https://app.notion.com/p/3d57f32d407581d9a9eafcdb4d5ac152)
is the product acceptance authority. Keep its full scope: guided solo and two-login
onboarding; consent and private finances; owned/equal/custom category budgets;
reconciled spending; Sandbox banking with manual fallback; confirmed due dates and
reminders; persisted, explainable avalanche/snowball plans; PostgreSQL and UI proof.
No milestone below alone means beta completion.

## 2026-09-08 — baseline and instruction reconciliation

- Started from freshly fetched main `39111a17e73d18719862232d93ace70890272a3a`
  on `codex/couples-beta`. Previous checkout `afc7cef` had the same tracked tree.
- Preserved pre-existing uncommitted CLAUDE.md Windows/release/continuity notes.
  Added current authority and replaced loss-aversion mandates in both agent files.
- Updated README and product principles to include required banking, budgeting and
  debt capabilities, separate implemented foundation from beta acceptance, and
  preserve calm language and architecture.
- `corepack pnpm --filter @worthlane/core --filter @worthlane/contracts --filter @worthlane/api test`
  passed: core 29, contracts 8, API 136 (173 total). API database calls are mocked;
  these results do not establish persistence.
- `corepack pnpm typecheck` failed before TypeScript: Turbo resolved the bundled
  fallback pnpm shim and attempted dependency removal without a TTY.
- `corepack pnpm -r --if-present typecheck` passed all workspace typecheck scripts.
  Use this command for local typechecks until the Turbo PATH issue is resolved;
  do not purge dependencies merely to satisfy the fallback shim.
- Located PostgreSQL 17 initdb/pg_ctl binaries locally. No database was started or
  migrated, and no credentials or production services were exercised.

## Evidence gaps and next action

1. Build an isolated local PostgreSQL test harness, apply migrations only there,
   and test registration, solo creation, invitation/acceptance and reload with two
   distinct users. Existing smoke script assumes seeded users; it is insufficient
   for the onboarding acceptance journey.
2. Inspect and fix category accounting: current household summary filters amount
   greater than zero (refunds excluded), and applies spending by payer against
   that payer's allocation. Verify responsibility versus payer semantics with the
   acceptance fixtures before changing contracts/UI. Preserve visibility filtering;
   never fix coherence by revealing a private partner transaction.
3. Cover groceries 600 at 50/50, utilities 150 owned by one member, rent 1700 at
   60/40; odd cents, 0/100 shares, refunds, overspending, month boundaries, edited
   splits/history, and no duplicated household totals in persistent two-user tests.
4. Complete Sandbox connect/reconnect/sync/recovery/unlink and pending-to-posted,
   added/modified/removed reconciliation; label freshness/incomplete history and
   prevent duplicate imports, transfers, repayments and joint-account counting.
5. Implement verified due-date sources, distinguish card current/statement/minimum
   values, and saved debt estimates including zero APR, promotions, insufficient
   payments, cent rounding and disclosed assumptions.
6. Run interactive solo/two-user UI journeys and all regression builds, mobile
   export and relevant native tests. None has fresh evidence in this checkpoint.

Status: active; first documentation/offline baseline checkpoint completed. No
production changes or spending. Full beta acceptance remains unproven.

## 2026-09-08 — first PostgreSQL-backed journey

- Added `scripts/test-postgres.ps1`: creates a new loopback-only PostgreSQL 17
  cluster with synthetic data, applies all 12 migrations, runs the integration
  suite and stops the server. Test clusters/logs are retained under ignored `.tmp`.
  Fixed Windows process-output inheritance and process-tree waiting encountered
  while capturing launcher output; only task-created clusters were stopped.
- `./scripts/test-postgres.ps1` passed (exit 0): one composite journey covering
  three real registrations, solo setup, consent before access, wrong-user invite
  rejection, a two-member maximum, 600/150/1700 allocation fixtures, reconnect and
  fresh-login persistence, account owner-only sharing, summary-only denial of
  detail, full sharing and revocation. No Prisma or authentication mocks.
- This invokes actual Next route handlers in-process plus household services;
  it does not cover HTTP transport, cookies/BFF, logout, interactive UI, spending
  reconciliation, partner registration after an invitation, or concurrent joins.
- `corepack pnpm --filter @worthlane/api typecheck` passed.
- `corepack pnpm --filter @worthlane/api test` passed all 136 unit tests after
  separating integration tests from the default suite. `git diff --check` passed.
- Added an ephemeral PostgreSQL CI job. Remote execution remains unverified.
- Next: attach categorized transactions to these persisted fixtures and fix
  refund/payer semantics with explicit privacy scope; extend to concurrent
  invitations and full HTTP/UI journeys. Banking and debt acceptance still open.

## 2026-09-08 — responsibility independent of payer

- Household summary now allocates permitted category spending using the agreed
  responsibility plan, rather than subtracting payer activity only from that
  payer's allocation. Uses existing deterministic shared allocation rules.
- Desktop now shows individual remaining amounts; both clients label the visible
  activity scope and agreed-split behavior. Interactive layout QA remains open.
- Extended the real PostgreSQL journey: owner pays 101.01 for partner-owned
  utilities, producing 10101 applied / 4899 remaining for the partner; owner pays
  100.01 for equal groceries, producing 5000/5001 applied and 49999 total remaining.
  Both viewers agree while shared; revocation excludes private activity again.
- `./scripts/test-postgres.ps1` passed after the new assertions. API 136 unit
  tests and API/desktop/mobile typechecks passed. No production or banking calls.
- Refund classification remains unresolved: blindly subtracting all negative
  transactions would conflate refunds and income. Next add explicit spending
  classification/reconciliation, signed refund accounting, month-boundary and
  overspending fixtures, then HTTP/UI journey verification. This checkpoint does
  not establish a complete month or full beta acceptance.

## 2026-09-08 — explicit refund and exclusion storage

- Added additive migration `20260908120000_add_spending_treatment`: AUTO preserves
  legacy positive-spending behavior, REFUND explicitly includes negative credits,
  EXCLUDED omits transfers/repayments. Existing credits are not silently recast as
  refunds. Manual create and owner-only manual/imported PATCH accept treatment;
  list/create/update responses expose it. Positive refunds are rejected.
- Household summaries include confirmed refunds; signed applied spending and
  usage contracts allow net refunds greater than purchases without clamping money.
- `./scripts/test-postgres.ps1` applied 13 migrations and passed the expanded
  persisted journey: 100.01 purchase minus 20.01 refund equals 80; 900 income and
  500 excluded debit do not alter it; another 100 refund yields -20 net / 620
  remaining. Positive-refund creation returns 400.
- API 136 unit tests, contracts 8 tests, recursive workspace typechecks and
  `git diff --check` passed. Prisma regenerated locally; no live migration.
- Still incomplete: transaction-editor controls and shared client DTO fields,
  personal dashboard/report reconciliation, imported automatic classification,
  duplicate/transfer detection, date-boundary fixtures and interactive QA. Next
  carry treatment through both editing surfaces and unify all spending views;
  do not describe this backend checkpoint as complete refund UX or banking proof.

## 2026-09-08 — client treatment controls

- Existing mobile transactions (manual and imported) now offer owner-controlled
  treatment choices, show refund/excluded state and report save errors. Refund
  choice is available only for credits. Success invalidates transactions,
  dashboard, budgets and household summary queries.
- Desktop personal report rows now expose equivalent selectors through the
  existing authenticated management callback. The BFF permits only transaction
  PATCH containing a valid spendingTreatment; existing origin/session protection
  remains. Save/pending/error feedback is present and data reloads after saving.
- Desktop filtered category analysis includes confirmed refunds, excludes marked
  transfers/repayments, sums in cents and handles negative net amounts without
  negative-width bars. Shared client-local DTOs retain treatment on reload.
- Mobile and desktop typechecks and diff whitespace checks passed. Interactive
  verification remains pending: typechecks do not prove BFF transport, mobile
  dialog usability or save/reload behavior. Other personal dashboard/budget totals
  still need reconciliation. Next verify edits through HTTP/UI and unify those
  remaining aggregate queries; no full-beta completion claim.

## 2026-09-08 — personal and household refund totals agree

- Centralized spending/income query predicates. Personal budgets, dashboard,
  spending report, household summary and legacy nudge/streak/AI context queries
  now include confirmed refunds and omit excluded transfers. Income excludes
  confirmed refunds and excluded credits. Optional providers were not activated.
- Shared budget progress accepts net negative spending. Cashflow sums integer
  cents and treats refund credits as negative spending, not income.
- PostgreSQL journey now calls actual personal budget/dashboard/spending/cashflow
  handlers against the refund fixture: groceries spent -20 / remaining 620;
  overall spending 81.01; income 900; cashflow net 818.99. Matches household plan.
- `./scripts/test-postgres.ps1` passed with the final cent-summing implementation.
  Core 30 and API 136 unit tests passed; recursive workspace typechecks passed.
- Limits: this verifies treatment accounting, not identical period semantics
  (personal routes still use server-calendar dates and some include future rows).
  Weekly budget periods, household timezone alignment, stale-data indicators,
  imported automatic classification and interactive edits remain open. Next
  verify the HTTP/BFF/UI save path and repair date-period inconsistencies.

## 2026-09-08 — weekly budgets and current activity cutoff

- Added deterministic Sunday-start week ranges in shared core, including DST
  boundary handling. Personal budget and dashboard queries use the active
  household timezone (UTC before household setup) and actual weekly/monthly
  budget period. Prior-period snapshots follow the same period boundaries.
- Personal budgets and household summaries now cap applied activity at now;
  future-dated entries no longer reduce current remaining amounts.
- PostgreSQL fixture verifies a 50 weekly budget: previous-week 35 and future 100
  are excluded; current 10 produces spent 10 / remaining 40 in budgets and the
  dashboard. DST spring week and UTC-Sunday/local-Saturday cases pass core tests.
- `./scripts/test-postgres.ps1` passed; core now has 32 tests. Workspace
  typechecks and `git diff --check` passed; API regression tests were run.
- Still open: report/cashflow timezone alignment, old snapshot period labeling,
  split history, interactive classification saves, and full banking/debt/beta
  verification. No production migration or external service activation.

## 2026-09-08 — real HTTP/BFF session and refund editing

- Added optional `./scripts/test-postgres.ps1 -Http`, using a freshly migrated
  isolated cluster and local API/desktop servers, with synthetic sessions and
  optional integration credentials disabled. Task-created servers are stopped
  afterward; logs stay under ignored `.tmp`.
- Final run passed: desktop registration, HttpOnly session cookies, no access
  token in browser-facing registration JSON, anonymous PATCH denied, cross-origin
  PATCH denied, unsupported amount edit rejected by the narrow BFF, refund PATCH
  persisted through desktop GET, logout caused 401, and fresh login retained it.
- First attempt used 127.0.0.1 for desktop and received origin rejection. Harness
  now uses documented localhost desktop origin; no origin protection was relaxed.
- Both PostgreSQL journeys also passed in the final run. This is real HTTP
  transport and cookie-header evidence, not browser policy enforcement: the test
  client carries cookies explicitly. HTTPS Secure-cookie behavior, rendered UI,
  mobile controls and complete two-user HTTP/UI onboarding remain unverified.
- Next: interactive desktop/solo/two-user acceptance and fixes surfaced there,
  alongside outstanding historical split behavior, Sandbox banking and debt.

## 2026-09-08 — report month boundaries

- Spending and cashflow reports now resolve the active household timezone (UTC
  for users without a household), using shared inclusive/exclusive month ranges.
  The default report month follows that timezone. Future transactions are capped
  at now, including explicit future report requests.
- Added a real PostgreSQL boundary journey with only the JavaScript Date clock
  fixed: at 2026-09-01 02:00 UTC, Phoenix is still in August. Spending report,
  cashflow and dashboard show August spending 7; cashflow puts the prior-boundary
  3 in July and excludes future 9 at the September local boundary.
- `./scripts/test-postgres.ps1` passed both persisted journeys; API typecheck and
  `git diff --check` passed. No provider calls or production changes.
- Next priority: actual HTTP/BFF and interactive classification/save/logout
  verification. Historical snapshot/split semantics, onboarding polish, Sandbox
  banking, due-date/debt flows and full regression builds remain unfinished.

## 2026-09-08 — rendered solo onboarding and fresh category bootstrap

- Browser registration with synthetic credentials reached household setup and a
  real authenticated dashboard. Solo setup required no partner. The monthly-plan
  form saved a 600 Food & Drink responsibility, assigned 100% to the solo member,
  and the dashboard retained 600 remaining after a full browser reload.
- This check exposed two defects: a fresh migration-only database had no standard
  categories, and dashboard month labels were hardcoded to July. Added a reference
  data migration for all 16 existing standard categories, preserving prior IDs.
  Summary now carries an optional asOf timestamp; dashboard labels use its month
  in the household timezone. Browser verified September / September 2026.
- Added -Interactive to the isolated runner, retaining the local synthetic API
  and desktop for at most 15 minutes with an explicit stop-file mechanism. The
  browser tab was closed; its server ports were confirmed no longer listening.
- Final ./scripts/test-postgres.ps1 -Http passed all 14 migrations, three real
  PostgreSQL checks (including repeat category bootstrap with identical IDs and
  no demo users), and HTTP/BFF session/refund/logout persistence. Exit 0 confirmed
  database/server shutdown. Workspace typechecks and 176 unit/contract tests
  (32 core, 8 contracts, 136 API) passed; git diff --check passed.
- Browser evidence covers localhost registration, solo setup, category save and
  reload. It does not establish HTTPS deployment, two-user rendered acceptance,
  mobile/native behavior, banking or debt readiness. Screenshot inspection covered
  the desktop dashboard viewport only.
- Next: invitations currently silently ignore unregistered partners. Implement a
  consent-safe registration/join path, then verify two-user UI ownership/splits and
  privacy. Historical split policy, Sandbox banking, due-date/debt flows and full
  regression builds remain required. No production changes or spending.

## 2026-09-08 — invitation before partner registration

- New invitations persist an intended email and SHA-256 hash of a random 192-bit
  private code. The owner shares the code directly; no mail provider is implied
  or activated. A recipient registers/signs in with the intended email and
  explicitly accepts. Code expiry remains seven days; reissue rotates the code.
  Raw codes are returned once to the owner and are not stored in the database.
- New invitations cannot be listed or accepted by member ID alone. Existing
  pre-migration invitations retain their original ID-based acceptance path.
  Acceptance checks the active two-member limit inside the serializable transaction.
- Desktop setup now offers code acceptance; desktop owner controls show the code.
  Mobile household setup offers code acceptance and owner invitation creation.
  These new rendered controls have typecheck evidence but await interactive QA.
- PostgreSQL journey now invites before registration, registers the partner,
  reissues without duplicating the reserved slot, rejects the superseded code,
  rejects a different login and ID-only acceptance, accepts the intended user,
  clears the token hash, and rejects a stale third-member invitation. Existing
  saved split, privacy, refund and calendar assertions still pass.
- ./scripts/test-postgres.ps1 -Http passed the new two-client BFF flow: invitation
  before registration, acceptance, private-account isolation, partner logout/login
  persistence. After adding the acceptance-time limit, ./scripts/test-postgres.ps1
  passed all three DB journeys again with exit 0 and server shutdown. API tests
  (136), contracts (8), workspace typechecks and git diff --check passed.
- One initial typecheck overlapped the dev harness rebuilding .next/types and
  failed on disappearing generated files; rerun after server shutdown passed.
- Next: interactive two-user registration/code/budget/split/save verification,
  including code display and setup navigation. Full mobile/native acceptance,
  historical split handling, Sandbox banking, due dates/debt and builds remain
  open. No production changes, emails or spending.

## 2026-09-08 — two-login browser budget acceptance

- Actual browser forms registered synthetic Alex, created a household, generated
  Sam's invitation before Sam registered, and added a 1000 manual checking account
  defaulting to Personal. After owner logout, Sam registered and entered the code
  in setup to explicitly join. Sam's dashboard showed zero visible net worth and
  no account name/detail, while Alex's fresh login showed the private 1000.
- Alex created all acceptance fixtures through the monthly-plan form: groceries
  600 equal (300 each), utilities 150 assigned to Sam, rent 1700 at 60/40
  (1020/680). Total 2450; member assignments 1320/1130. Sam's fresh login and full
  reload retained all three allocations and remaining amounts without Alex's
  private account. This used sequential separate logins in one browser profile.
- Screenshot QA found the dashboard responsibility grid overflowing its panel
  beside the goal card. Reflowed each row into heading/amount, progress, then
  member allocations; made the surrounding columns shrink to available width.
  Follow-up screenshot at the same desktop viewport showed contained amounts.
- ./scripts/test-postgres.ps1 -Interactive first passed three DB journeys and
  the HTTP/BFF suite. The tab was closed. On cleanup the session handle was gone
  and ports 55439/3301/3303 had no listeners; no servers were restarted.
  git diff --check passed. CSS-only change was verified visually, without new
  mirror tests. This is desktop localhost evidence, not HTTPS/native/mobile QA.
- Still required: interactive transaction classifications and privacy changes,
  historical split handling, Sandbox banking/reconciliation, due-date/debt plans,
  native/mobile acceptance and full regression builds. Next inspect banking flow.

## 2026-09-08 — desktop banking entry points and live Sandbox connectivity

- Added desktop Connect bank and Reconnect controls using Plaid's official CDN
  Web SDK, with cancellation/error feedback and manual fallback. Update mode
  syncs the existing Item rather than exchanging another public token. Extended
  the existing same-origin authenticated BFF with narrow Link/exchange payloads.
  Existing CSP already allows the official Plaid script/frame origins.
- Live node scripts/test-plaid-sandbox.mjs --live-sandbox passed: create Link
  token; create/exchange a synthetic Item; 14 Sandbox accounts; initial sync;
  simulate ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED; create update-mode token; remove task-created
  Item. Script hardcodes Sandbox base URL, requires explicit sandbox env/flag,
  never opens the app database, and logs no credentials/tokens/response bodies.
- This is direct provider evidence, not a persisted app sync or interactive
  reconnect result. Local API credentials work in Sandbox; app token encryption
  configuration still needs an isolated test key before exercising stored Items.
- ./scripts/test-postgres.ps1 -Http passed three DB journeys and HTTP suite,
  including new Link/exchange BFF auth, origin, platform and field validation.
  Desktop typecheck and git diff --check passed. No production activation.
- Next: isolated persistent app/Sandbox connect-sync-error-unlink and actual
  desktop Link/reconnect UI. OAuth redirect resumption, native autolinking and
  mobile Link remain incomplete; do not claim broad bank coverage yet. Preserve
  manual fallback while proving added/modified/removed/pending reconciliation.
- References: https://plaid.com/docs/link/web/ (CDN SDK),
  https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode/ (no re-exchange in update mode),
  https://plaid.com/docs/api/sandbox/ (test Items and login-required simulation).

## 2026-09-08 — persisted application Sandbox banking

- Added ./scripts/test-postgres.ps1 -Sandbox. It creates the isolated database,
  runs ordinary DB journeys, then loads local Sandbox credentials only into a
  child process with a random temporary encryption key. No production database
  or durable environment file is changed. Sandbox config selects only its own
  test file; live calls remain outside the ordinary offline suite.
- Final run passed three existing PostgreSQL journeys plus the new app-route
  Sandbox test: register separate users, exchange synthetic Item, persist AES-GCM
  encrypted token/accounts, import nonempty transaction history, repeat sync with
  unchanged row count, reject another user's sync/relink/unlink, force login
  required, persist needsRelink/error code, issue update Link token, unlink both
  upstream and local Item/accounts/transactions. Exit 0 and DB shutdown confirmed.
- First run found another-user sync returned empty success; fixed requested
  missing/non-owned Item to return 404. Also fixed Vitest config array merging
  accidentally rerunning fresh-DB checks after population. Task-created provider
  Item cleanup ran in the failure path; final test used normal app unlink.
- API unit suite (136), API typecheck and git diff --check passed. Test diagnostics
  identify stages without exposing provider headers, tokens or response bodies.
- This verifies app route + PostgreSQL + live Sandbox, not browser Link success
  or completed interactive reconnect. Still required: added/modified/removed and
  pending reconciliation, joint-account/import dedupe, freshness/history signals,
  OAuth resumption, native banking, due dates/debt and full beta regression gates.
- Next: interactive desktop Sandbox flow with a separately scoped encryption key,
  and deterministic reconciliation coverage. Native/mobile remains unverified.

## 2026-09-08 — atomic posted-transaction reconciliation

- Replaced independent transaction writes/cursor update with one serializable
  batch. A stale cursor returns a retryable conflict without overwriting a newer
  successful Item state. Unknown accounts fail the batch rather than silently
  advancing past unimported activity; owner collisions roll back the entire batch.
- Bank spending now uses posted transactions. Pending events are excluded, and
  posted replacements remove any legacy pending row by pending_transaction_id.
  Desktop banking copy makes this posted-only scope explicit. Pending holds are
  not a separate supported spending view in this beta.
- Added categoryOverridden tracking to user category edits so future sync does
  not overwrite them. The migration conservatively preserves existing categorized
  imports because earlier rows did not distinguish manual category edits. Notes
  and explicit spending treatment remain preserved during modified events.
- New real-PostgreSQL deterministic batch coverage verifies pending exclusion,
  legacy pending replacement, replay without duplicate rows, modified amount,
  user-category/note/treatment preservation, stale-cursor rejection, full rollback
  on a later ownership collision, and owner-scoped removals.
- Final ./scripts/test-postgres.ps1 -Sandbox passed all 16 migrations, four DB
  tests and live persisted Sandbox banking, including Item cleanup; exit 0 and
  database shutdown confirmed. API unit tests (136), workspace typechecks and
  git diff --check passed. No production migration or activation.
- Still required: bank-date timezone semantics, transfer/card-payment and joint
  account/import dedupe, incomplete-history/freshness signals, interactive Link
  recovery, OAuth/native banking, historical splits, debt/due dates and full builds.

## 2026-09-08 — bank calendar dates and money movement defaults

- Save the provider calendar posting date independently and normalize its instant
  to the active household timezone (UTC before household setup). On create/join,
  rebase bank dates within the onboarding transaction; manual timestamps stay put.
  Sync reads membership inside its serializable transaction.
- New imports labeled TRANSFER_IN/TRANSFER_OUT or credit card payment default to
  EXCLUDED, preventing movement from inflating spending or income. Mortgage
  payments remain expenses and wage credits remain income. Explicit user treatment
  edits survive later sync. Desktop copy explains the editable defaults.
- Migration preserves treatment for all historical imports conservatively because
  older rows cannot distinguish user edits; historical AUTO movements still need
  user review. Fresh migration deployment tested; populated legacy migration and
  invitation-acceptance rebasing need dedicated additional fixtures.
- Source: https://plaid.com/documents/transactions-personal-finance-category-taxonomy.csv
- Verification: core37/API136 tests and recursive workspace typechecks passed.
  test-postgres.ps1 -Sandbox passed 17 migrations, 4 DB integration tests and the
  live persisted Sandbox test, including cleanup and confirmed DB shutdown.
  DB assertions cover default movement totals, preserved overrides, household
  date rebasing, manual timestamp preservation and subsequent synced dates.
  git diff --check passed. Root db:generate hit the known fallback pnpm shim;
  direct corepack pnpm --filter @worthlane/db db:generate succeeded.
- Remaining: interactive Link/recovery, OAuth/native, joint/manual-import dedupe,
  freshness/history indicators, historical splits, due dates/debt and full builds.
  No production migration, deployment or spending.

## 2026-09-08 — bank history coverage and retrieval notices

- Persist Plaid transactions_update_status in the same atomic batch as cursor and
  transaction changes. Unknown/absent provider values fail conservatively to
  UNKNOWN; existing Items migrate to UNKNOWN until verified by another sync.
- Accounts API exposes owner-only history status and calm notices. Desktop
  planning/account views and mobile dashboard/profile display loading, unconfirmed,
  stale retrieval, connection attention and limited-history notices. Successful
  retrieval does not claim the bank itself is current or guarantee full months.
- Source: https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/ (sync response status).
- Passed core39/API136 unit tests, recursive workspace typechecks and diff check.
  test-postgres.ps1 -Sandbox passed 18 migrations, 4 DB tests and persisted Sandbox
  lifecycle/cleanup. DB proves partial-history persistence and stale-cursor rejection
  cannot overwrite it. Sandbox verifies accounts notice serialization and stranger
  isolation. Database shutdown confirmed; no production activity.
- Remaining: rendered notice QA, dedicated desktop overview and all mobile spending
  surface coverage, privacy-safe partner permitted-account coverage warnings,
  provider last-successful-update timestamps, joint/manual-import deduplication,
  interactive Link/recovery/OAuth/native, debt/due dates and full acceptance builds.
